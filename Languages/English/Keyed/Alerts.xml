	<ATR_AlertServerHeatCritical>Heat Sensitive Device Critical</ATR_AlertServerHeatCritical>
	<ATR_AlertServerHeatCriticalDesc>At least one heat sensitive device is in danger of combusting due to surpassing its maximum safety heat threshold! Action is required to retain network integrity!</ATR_AlertServerHeatCriticalDesc>

	<ATR_AlertFullSkillServers>Full Skill Servers</ATR_AlertFullSkillServers>
    <ATR_AlertFullSkillServersDesc>There is no more capacity for skill points. Consider using them, or expanding capacity.</ATR_AlertFullSkillServersDesc>

	<ATR_AlertFullHackingServers>Full Hacking Servers</ATR_AlertFullHackingServers>
    <ATR_AlertFullHackingServersDesc>There is no more capacity for hacking points and there is no current time penalty. Consider using them, or expanding capacity.</ATR_AlertFullHackingServersDesc>

    <ATR_AlertLowSecurity>Network At Risk</ATR_AlertLowSecurity>
	<ATR_AlertLowSecurityDesc>The number of available security points is exceedingly unlikely to successfully defend against any attempted hacks! Additional security servers and points are required - extreme caution should be practiced around network use at this time.</ATR_AlertLowSecurityDesc>
