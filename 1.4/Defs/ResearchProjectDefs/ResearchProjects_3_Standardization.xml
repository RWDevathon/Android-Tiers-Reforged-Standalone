        <description>In order to reach a state of consistent manufactured quality and scaling quantity, a standard of production and maintenance must be established. Androids come in a vast number of styles and designs - standardizing the colony's parts will be critical for success in mechanical fields.</description>

        <description>The framework of a mechanical unit is its most visible feature, as it quite literally holds the entire chassis together. Framework modifications could result in significant gains in a wide range of particular tasks - but does require committing to one particular modification at a time.</description>

        <description>The specialization of frameworks follows the same trend from novelty to economy as the utilization of the T1's expanded. These allow basic drones to match or exceed the performance of a regular worker without the difficulties of biological needs, or more advanced machines to be shackled to similar purpose...</description>

		<description>More than the provision of mere componentry and assistance tools, the inclusion of basic mechanites allows for many simple damages which can arise during repair or modification works to simply be smoothed over and perfected. This serves to greatly increase the quality of work performed by any marginally competent mechanic.</description>

        <description>If physical standardization can be achieved, then there should similarly be a method for standardizing the methods of communication, thought, and philosophy. The advent of a theoretical cloud environment connecting consciousnesses could promise vast improvements across many fields. A simple relay tower allowing mechanical intra-net communications is a strong start.</description>

        <description>With standardized communication methods across hosts, it is theoretically possible to develop a framework for remotely controlling so-called surrogate bodies. Technical limitations prevent organic involvement in this service due to a lack of efficiency and universal organic applications, but this could prove revolutionary for mechanical units.</description>
