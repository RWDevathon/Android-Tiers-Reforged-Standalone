        <description>Standardization alone will not solve everything - further progress will require a revolution of efficiency and precision. New standards for optimization, accuracy, and capability will need to be developed. Once achieved, humanity's more wild ideas fall within reach.</description>

		<description>Tier three androids are marked by their scale and sheer capabilities. Dwarfing humans at an average height of 7-9 feet - necessary to contain the vast requisite resources for operation - and intimidating in both strength and acuity, these units are clear evolutions of human design.</description>

        <description>With a great deal of advancement in both fabrication capabilities and protocol optimization, it may very well be possible to develop a method for organics to both become and utilize surrogates. This is a revolutionary capability, but one fraught with moral and ethical concerns. Is this a line that shouldn't be crossed?</description>

It is incredibly expensive, but it offers a glimpse of immortality. Acquiring and coaxing so many AI personas to play babysitter and host will be difficult. Finding the vanometric power cells necessary to keep the superstructure secure and isolated may be equally difficult.</description>
